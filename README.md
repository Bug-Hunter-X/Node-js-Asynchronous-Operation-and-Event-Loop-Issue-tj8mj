# Node.js Asynchronous Operation and Event Loop Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js related to asynchronous operations and the event loop.  The server, although seemingly simple, might not respond immediately to requests due to how asynchronous tasks are handled.

## Problem

The `bug.js` file contains a simple Express.js server.  A `setTimeout` function with a delay of 0 simulates an asynchronous operation.  While this delay is minimal, it can still demonstrate the event loop behavior.  In high-load scenarios or with more intensive asynchronous operations, this delay could lead to noticeable response time issues or even server unresponsiveness.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to mitigate this issue by carefully structuring asynchronous operations and potentially using techniques like promises or async/await.  These techniques ensure that the event loop is not blocked by lengthy asynchronous work.  For simpler cases, ensuring the server uses appropriate `async` or `await` might be sufficient to prevent this issue.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install required dependencies.
4. Run `node bug.js` to execute the buggy code and `node bugSolution.js` to execute the fixed code.
5. Test the server by making requests to `http://localhost:3000`.
